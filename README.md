The Odin Project: Recipes Project

This project is an introduction to HTML and demonstrates basic use of HTML as well as use of Git in combination with Github. 

This project showcases the use of creating repos on Github and cloning them to a local machine and then using git add and git commit to commit changes made and git push to push the changes back to Github.

This project also showcases the use of HTML elements such as headings, list, links and images in order to construct simple webpages.
